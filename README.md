# jog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qiangyt/jog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qiangyt/jog)
Tool for viewing local log, replacing `tail -f <log file> && grep <keyword>`

## Features
The purpose is to help engineers to easily view local log files, not alternative of stuff like ELK:

   - Filtering by time range and log level
   - Full-text searching log by arbitrary fields
   - Convert and view JSON log as flat lines
   - Views ELK log as stream, jsut like `tail -f`
   - Colorizes the log files, for example, bold and red highlighted error
   - The configuration could be shareable by team to consistent reusable log view during development, via GIT

It has both terminal mode and Web GUI mode as well. The Web GUI is supported by an embedded web server running locally. Both modes supports reading input stream from files and stdin, like 'tail -f ...'.

Besides ELK, another ongoing work is to view the log as stream, like `tail -f`, but upon outputted log from Splunk and others log service from IaaS vendors.

The filter expression is SQL style, almost no learning cost for developers

One of target is to easy use in pratical, so it's written using Go, compiled as single file binaries without extra dependencies; And it is cross-platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). The binaryies is downloadable them from releases.

The roadmap includes a Visual Studio Code extension as well so that we could one-click open log by JOG in Visual Studio Code.

See detailed feature tables [#Detailed Feature Table].

## Background

Such a tool like `tail -f <log file> && grep <keyword>` is still needed besides ELK, because:

1. ELK is not available everywhere all the time, for example, before log is connected to ELK, during initial development. It's overkilled for local development to output log to ELK, of course.

2. Streamed view of logs, by `tail -f`, is better than ELK in some cases.

Another important reason is that JSON log, AKA. structured log, becomes more and more popular, but JSON log is not convienent for developers to read. I know 2 approaches to do that:

1. Some logging library, such as Bunyan (https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan), provides built-in tool to convert and view JSON log. However, it is only for Bunyan log format, that also means available only for Node.js applications only. In pratical, there're other issues for approach #1. For ex., I heavily use docker-compose for local development, however, `docker-compose log -f` inserts service name before each of log lines from containers, another example is PM2, a process management tool, which inserts extra process information before log lines too, all of such tools will break built-in tools like bunyan.

2. Sets up 2 different log appenders, one outputing JSON log to ELK, another outputting regular flat lines to console. That works fine but with extra effort and complexity. And another drawback is, a JSON log appender usually automatically outputs all fields, but a reuglar flag line log appender doesnot by default. I have to manually keep them synced up for new fields.

With a So,This tool can on-the-fly convert JSON log to traditional space-separated flat line log, friendly for developers. It then removes the effort to maintenain different output format for different environments (for ex. JSON log for test / production, but flat line log for local development).

## Design thinking

1. Feature should be flexible and customizable, but the default one should work well enough.

2. Detect to get default

Log level value are quite similar too: INFO, WARN, ERROR, .... For exceptional cases, for example, Bunyan takes a number value 50 as ERROR level, this is doable by customizing the configuration profile. For Bunyan, that is built-in already. For others, we prefer to get them built-in too for the purpose of easy usage, could you help to submit a PR or an issue? |

Jog supports ELK GROK to parse the datetime format. Datetime format usually follows ISO standards, so Jog provides built-in ISO datetime GROK and tries to extract them automatically. And actually, if don't need time-range filtering, we don't need datetime extraction mostlikely, just present datetime fields as plain text. |

   |                                               | [x] 3.15 Detect various of JSON format                | There're various of JSON log format, major differences are just different keywords and level value and so on. Their keywords are quite similar and nearly able to be listed exhaustively via a case-insensitive dictionary. The dictionary is customizable. By detect those keywords, the default built-in conversion will work for most cases, without need to customization. And by comparing of matching keywords, we could tell if or not the input matches which known format. The target is to built-in support as many as possible known formats. |
   |                                               | [x] 3.16 Support JSON lines mixed with regular lines  | Try best to convert the lines as JSON. If failed, take the line as non-JSON line, straightforward. For ex., for springboot banner lines. |
   |                                               | [x] 3.17 Support JSON having non-JSON prefix          | For example, `docker-compose log -f` inserts service name before each of log lines from containers, then follows by JSON lines. Such prefix is extracted and remaining JSON parts could be still recognized. |
   |                                               | [x] 3.18 Support nested JSON fields                   |        |

   |                                               | [x] 4.3 Colorization                                  | For example, highlight log level with different color. Have built-in 16 RGB color, with extra style (bold, italic, background, ...) |
   |                                               | [x] 4.4 Compress prefix                              | Some fields, for ex., file name, class name, logger names, may be a long and tedious fully-qualified. 'Compress prefix' could shorten them. We could specify prefix separators, for ex.. `.`(dot) or `/` (file path separator), and define the compress action: either remove non-first-letter or remove the whole prefix. We could specify a white-list as well to skip compressing for specific prefixs.
   Many JAVA logging framework themselves supports compress already by removing non-first letter of package names, but we recommend to keep them uncompressed and use Jog to do the compression so that we could keep original full qualified message. When we found compressed logger names are not easy to read, we could dynamically turn off the compress to get back original full-qualified name back. That is more flexible than doing that in logger framework.

Jog looks up them in locations: `$PWD/.jog`, `$HOME/.jog`,  `etc/.jog`. Jog configuration files in `$PWD/.jog` could be commited to project git repository to trace and share in the team. |
   |                                               | [] 6.2 Built-in default configuration file           | The built-in default configuration file is intellegent enough so most-likely works enough good. Run `jog -t` to see configuration example, and `jog -t full` to see full configuration items. |
   |                                               | [] 6.3 Support multiple profile                      | Each YAML configuration file specifies one profile which is the combination of output pattern & field extraction & field definition ..., and the file name is the profile name.
